#Discogs bulk comment-field Userscript
=====================================

This is a userscript which allows sellers at discogs.com to bulk modify the public comment field. The userscript allows them to prepend, suffix and replace text within that field.

#How to use
1. Go to your inventary (https://www.discogs.com/sell/manage).
2. Select the items you want to edit (you can checkbox them all with the green checkmark image).
3. Click the Edit-Button.
4. Voil√†. The script will show a small menu above your items. Pretty  self-explanatory, hm? :)


#Compatibility

#Warning
You use this script at your own risk. Although I tested this script thoroughly, I can not be held responsible for any damage this script may cause (e.g. setting wrong prices on your items to sell). Always double-check which changes have been made before submitting on discogs.com!
